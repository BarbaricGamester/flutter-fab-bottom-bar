# flutter-fab-bottom-bar
This is a trick I came up with to make a beautiful looking navigation bar with custom button in center.

## General Usage
* You first define a ``BottomNavigationBar`` in your page ``Scaffold``, add 5 items to bottom navigation bar (This is for alignment of the buttons, you can also try 3 buttons).
